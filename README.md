level
=====================


## Description

If you've worked with out-of-the-box databse solutions before and went beyond the simple every-day use cases,
you know how odd it is to have to either bend your application into the database's abstraction, or the other way around.
Your stack gets bigger and bigger with every datbase you have to add, making you less agile and effective.

LevelDB on the other hand - being merely a well designed unopinionated building block - lets you create your persistent datastructures just the way you need them, and with the right node modules at hand you can build applications in no time, without adding much ballast as it's all writen in JavaScript.

## With this training, you will learn

- how to do basic leveldb operations from node
- how database views work
- how database indexes work
- how some consistency guarantees can be achieved
- how to modularize your database
- how to write and publish a `level-*` module

Stretch goals:

- how to write a streaming leveldb webservice
- how to talk to a leveldb from the browser
